Intro
-----

Paparazzi is an attempt to develop a cheap fixed wing UAV (Unmanned Air
Vehicle).  As of today we have successfully flown autonomously several small
electro powered fixed wing aircraft (Twinstar, Microjet, ...).

Up to date informations are available from the wiki website

	paparazzi.enac.fr

and from the mailing list (http://savannah.nongnu.org/mail/?group=paparazzi)
and the IRC channel (freenode, #paparazzi).

Directories quick and dirty description:
---------------------------------------

conf: the configuration directory (airframe, radio, ... descriptions).

data: where to put read-only data (e.g. maps, terrain elevation files, icons)

hw: hardware (electronic schemas, PCBs, ...)

sw: software (onboard, ground station, simulation, ...)

var: products of compilation, cache for the map tiles, ...

debian: Debian packaging control files


Required Software
-----------------
 - OCaml (ocaml.org), xml-light library (http://tech.motion-twin.com/xmllight)
 - gcc, GTK2, Glib2, libgnomecanvas, libxml2
 - ARM7 micro-controller development environnment (gcc, loader, libc, binutils)
 - ...

For Debian users: Required packages are available at

	http://www.recherche.enac.fr/paparazzi/debian

Installation of the meta-package "paparazzi-dev" will install
everything needed to compile this project (if something is missing,
please ask) for simulation. "paparazzi-arm7" is required to compile
the code for the ARM based boards.

Compilation and demo simulation
-------------------------------

  1) "make" in the top directory to compile all the tools.

  2) "./paparazzi" to run the Paparazzi Center

  3) Select the "MJ5" or the "TJ1" aircraft in the upper-left A/C
combo box. Select "sim" from upper-middle "target" combo box. Click
"Build". When the compilation is finished, select "Simulation" from
the upper-right session combo box and click "Execute".

  4) In the GCS, wait about 10s for the aircraft to be in the "Holding
point" navigation block. Switch to the "Takeoff" block (lower-left
blue airway button in the strip). Takeoff with the green launch button.

Uploading of the embedded software
----------------------------------

  1) Power the flight controller board while it is connected to the PC with
the USB cable.

  2) From the Paparazzi center, select the "ap" target, and click "Upload".


Flight
-------------------------------------

  1) From the Paparazzi Center, select the flight session and ... do
the same than in simulation !
