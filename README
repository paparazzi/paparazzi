Intro
-----

Paparazzi is an attempt to develop a free software Unmanned (Air) Vehicle System.
 As of today the system is being used successfuly by a number of hobyists, universities and companies all over the world, on vehicle of various size ( 100g to 25Kg ) and of various nature ( fixed wing, rotorcrafts, boats and surface vehicles).

Up to date informations are available from the wiki website

    http://paparazzi.enac.fr

and from the mailing list (http://savannah.nongnu.org/mail/?group=paparazzi)
and the IRC channel (freenode, #paparazzi).

Directories quick and dirty description:
---------------------------------------

conf: the configuration directory (airframe, radio, ... descriptions).

data: where to put read-only data (e.g. maps, terrain elevation files, icons)

sw: software (onboard, ground station, simulation, ...)

var: products of compilation, cache for the map tiles, ...

debian: Debian packaging control files


Required Software
-----------------

Installation is described in the wiki (paparazzi.enac.fr/wiki/Installation).
Main requirements include
 - OCaml (ocaml.org), xml-light library (http://tech.motion-twin.com/xmllight)
 - gcc, GTK2, Glib2, libgnomecanvas, libxml2
 - ARM7 micro-controller development environnment (gcc, loader, libc, binutils)
 - ...

For Debian or Ubuntu users, required packages are available at

    http://paparazzi.enac.fr/debian


  - "paparazzi-dev" will provide everything needed to compile and run the ground segment and the simulator. If something is missing, please report it.
  - "paparazzi-arm7" is required to compile the code for LPC21 based boards ( tiny, twog, booz, etc).
  - "paparazzi-stm32" is needed for building code for STM32 based boards (lisa/L, lisa/M)
  - "paparazzi-omap" is needed for building code for the optional Gumstix Overo module available on lisa/L

  - "paparazzi-jsbsim" is needed for using jsbsim as flight dynamic model for the simulator.

Compilation and demo simulation
-------------------------------

  1) type "make" in the top directory to compile all the libraries and tools.

  2) "./paparazzi" to run the Paparazzi Center

  3) Select the "Microjet" aircraft in the upper-left A/C
combo box. Select "sim" from upper-middle "target" combo box. Click
"Build". When the compilation is finished, select "Simulation" from
the upper-right session combo box and click "Execute".

  4) In the GCS, wait about 10s for the aircraft to be in the "Holding
point" navigation block. Switch to the "Takeoff" block (lower-left
blue airway button in the strip). Takeoff with the green launch button.

Uploading of the embedded software
----------------------------------

  1) Power the flight controller board while it is connected to the PC with
the USB cable.

  2) From the Paparazzi center, select the "ap" target, and click "Upload".


Flight
-------------------------------------

  1) From the Paparazzi Center, select the flight session and ... do
the same than in simulation !
