Airframes List
==========================

There is a wide number of airframes that are already usable in Paparazzi. Such airframes are meant to run on a particular vehicle configuration, 
and if such vehicle is available to the user, they can be flashed straightforwardly. Some of these configurations are experimental vehicles, but some 
are available for purchase. This library particularly focuses on the latter.
