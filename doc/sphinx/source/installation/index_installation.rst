Paparazzi is easily installed on any laptop or workstation running the Ubuntu Linux OS or virtually any Debian based Linux. Apple Macintosh running Mac OS X system are also fairly well supported. Windows is supported through the WSL2 module (running a Linux kernel inside Windows10).

The steps required to install the software needed to be able to let your UAS fly are:

- Install tools and prerequisites needed by Paparazzi
- Download the source code from the source repository
- Compile the Paparazzi software from sourcecode
- Complete any final configuration

.. note::

    If you run **Ubuntu** 18.04 or higher LTS (20.04, 22.04), go to the :doc:`../quickstart/install` page to get quickly running !
