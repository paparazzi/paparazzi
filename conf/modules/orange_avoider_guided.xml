This module is an example module for the course AE4317 Autonomous Flight of Micro Air Vehicles at the TU Delft.
This module is used in combination with a color filter (cv_detect_color_object) and the guided mode of the autopilot.
The avoidance strategy is to simply count the total number of orange pixels. When above a certain percentage threshold,
(given by color_count_frac) we assume that there is an obstacle and we turn.

The color filter settings are set using the cv_detect_color_object. This module can run multiple filters simultaneously
so you have to define which filter to use with the ORANGE_AVOIDER_VISUAL_DETECTION_ID setting.
This module differs from the simpler orange_avoider.xml in that this is flown in guided mode. This flight mode is
less dependent on a global positioning estimate as with the navigation mode. This module can be used with a simple
speed estimate rather than a global position.

Here we also need to use our onboard sensors to stay inside of the cyberzoo and not collide with the nets. For this
we employ a simple color detector, similar to the orange poles but for green to detect the floor. When the total amount
of green drops below a given threshold (given by floor_count_frac) we assume we are near the edge of the zoo and turn
around. The color detection is done by the cv_detect_color_object module, use the FLOOR_VISUAL_DETECTION_ID setting to 
define which filter to use.
