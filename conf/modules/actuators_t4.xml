      Module to set Serialbus servos, PWM ESC's, DShot ESC's and PWM servos connected to a Teensy 4.0 based T4 module.
      Optionally also get status information returned e.g. RPM, Angle, Force, Temperature, Current.

      T4 hardware consists of a basic Teensy 4.0 PCB with specific firmware.

      Pre-compiled firmware for this board is already available in the paparazzi repository, so one can just upload it.
      For this one needs the Teensy Loader application and this included HEX firmware file. 
      
      Connect your Teensy to your computer with USB data cable. Then run the Teensy loader app. 
      Drop the HEX file onto Teensy Loader app and then Push the button on the Teensy.

      Next to it is also the full source code available in the sw/ext/t4/src directory.
      The firmware is based on the Teensyduino environment and can be compiled with the Arduino IDE.
