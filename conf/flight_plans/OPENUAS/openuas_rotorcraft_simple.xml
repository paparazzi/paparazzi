<!--
The goal of this flightplan is to try to provide an easy, no-brainer flightplan for your first 100pct autonomous Parrot Drone tryout flights.
It should be useable for UAS enthousiasts just starting in the field of autonomous Parrot Drone flights.
This flightplan should be kept as simple as possible and *not* to be extended with more functionality, if one needs that, plz use another flightplan.

For you first flights make sure you have more dan enough space and do not make decisions that would be unwise, you have a brain, best to put it to good use ;)
Your safe aircraft operation is *your* responsibility
