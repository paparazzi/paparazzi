Hobbyking 6CH RC Transmitter shaped USB HID joystick Mode 2
http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__20951__Hobbyking_6CH_RC_Flight_Simulator_System_Mode_2_.html

If you want to use this file for the same product but mode 1 the axis index
numbers have to be re-arranged, the rest will be exactly the same.

This RC TX joystick has four axes,2 buttons, one dial, which are labeled on the
RC TX joystick

The button and dial give their output on an **axis** type not button type

The button ""MIX" is not useful and hardwired to mixing and does NOT give
indepenadant output, better remove it from your RC joystick.

The 6CH Gyro switch only has 2 positions, not three :(
We will use it as mode switch none the less between, MANUAL (or ATT) and NAV

So it is a real 6CH USB joystick that just looks like a RC transmitter

If you want to fly your UAS via the joystick add thid to your session:

 /home/username/paparazzi/sw/ground_segment/joystick/input2ivy  -d 0 -ac yourarfamename hobbyking_usb_rc_6ch_rc_tx_joy_mode_2.xml

Where -d 0 must be -d 1 if you have a laptop with accelometer installed

The basis of steering is the standard signs of aerospace convention
