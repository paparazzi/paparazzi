# How to contribute

Third-party patches are essential for keeping Paparazzi great.
We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that
get things working in your use-case. There are a few guidelines that we
need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git branch
    my_contribution master` then checkout the new branch with `git
    checkout my_contribution`.  Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units with descriptive commit messages and note the corresponding issue (which GitHub will autolink), e.g.:
```
[modules] air_data: fix altitude calculation

- fix altitude calculation from differential pressure
- take geoid separation into account when calculating QNH

Fixes issue #123
```
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.

## Style

* C/C++ code: Two spaces, no tabs
* Use [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) comments
* Python: Four spaces, no tabs, see [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)
* No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any space.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/compare/) to the repository in the paparazzi organization. If this change improves the current code we will merge it immediately, but will create several issues with problems that were in your code. These issues will be assigned to you, and you will be asked to create a new pull request to fix these new issues.
