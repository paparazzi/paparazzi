#               Welcome in the future Paparazzi Center !                      #
###############################################################################

1) Run instructions :

To run the new Paparazzi Center, you need :

> A Linux or IOS system

> A correctly installed version of Paparazzi UAV software

> Python 3.4 (install package 'python3')

> PyQt5 (install package 'python3-pyqt5')

First "git pull" my part of code or copy the current "./sw/supervision/python"
version into your own "./sw/supervision" directory. No installation nor
compilation is needed.
Then, make the 'main.py' file executable ('chmod +x main.py') and launch the
program in a terminal ('./main.py') or from the paparazzi launcher (soon).

2) Feedback :

I'm an intern student at the ENAC and my mission is to reconceive the Paparazzi
Center in Python/Qt to make it more intuitive and 'maintainable' (that can
evolve easily). So I'd really like to have your feeling about my propositions !

If you have any question or comment about it, please contact me by
Github (my pseudo is 'floienac' and I use Gitter) or by mail
('f.bitard@gmail.com').
I'd be glad to be criticized, especially if you're directly concerned as a
final user or a developer of Paparazzi UAV.

Thanks by advance :)
