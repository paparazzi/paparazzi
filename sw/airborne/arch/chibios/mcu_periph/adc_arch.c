/**
 * @file arch/chibios/mcu_periph/adc_arch.c
 * ADC driver
 *
 * ADC defines for Lia board (STM32F105)
 * 5 Channels:
 * 1 - ADC1, Channel 13
 * 2 - ADC2, Channel 10
 * 3 - ADC3, Channel 11
 * 4 - ADC4, Channel 14
 * 5 - Temperature sensor, Channel 16
 *
 * Default buffer depth is equal to MAX_AV_NB_SAMPLE
 * This allows us to always have more or equal samples than the user requires
 *
 * @note: With ChibiOS/RT 2.6.2 and STM32F105 chip the channels have to be interleaved,
 * otherwise the current measurement is affected by the previous channel measured.
 * Most likely bug on ChibiOS ADC driver for this particular chip.
 *
 * For 5 actual channels we have to define (DUMMY stants for 1 dummy channel):
 * CH1 + DUMMY + CH2 + DUMMY + CH3 + DUMMY + CH4 + DUMMY + CH_TEMP = 9 channels
 * Then only every second channel is really read. Might be fixed in next version
 * of ChibiOS
 *
 * V_ref is 3.3V, ADC has 12bit resolution.
