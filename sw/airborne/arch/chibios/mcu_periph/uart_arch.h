/**
 * @file arch/chibios/mcu_periph/uart_arch.h
 * UART/Serial driver implementation for ChibiOS arch
 *
 * ChibiOS has a high level Serial Driver, for Paparazzi it is more convenient
 * than pure UART driver (which needs callbacks etc.). This implementation is
 * asynchronous and the RX thread has to use event flags. See ChibiOS documen-
 * tation.
