/**
 * @brief chibios arch dependant implementation of uart/serial drivers
 * @details Partially implemented (no error callbacks yet). Since ChibiOs
 * 			has SerialDriver, it is better to use that one instead of Uart
 * 			drivers, although it makes backward compatibility more difficutl.
 * 			DMA is already implemented.
