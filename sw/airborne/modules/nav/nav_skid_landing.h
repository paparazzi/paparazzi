 * @brief Landing on skidpads
 * See video of the landing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYrB7s3oeX4
 * Standard landing procedure:
 * 1) circle down passing AF waypoint (from left or right)
 * 2) once low enough follow line to TD waypoint
 * 3) once low enough flare
 *
 * Use this in your airfame config file:
 *   <section name="LANDING" prefix="SKID_LANDING_">
 *     <define name="AF_HEIGHT" value="50" unit="m"/>
 *     <define name="FINAL_HEIGHT" value="50" unit="m"/>
 *     <define name="FINAL_STAGE_TIME" value="10" unit="s"/>
 *   </section>
  *
 *   Also define:
 *    V_CTL_LANDING_THROTTLE_PGAIN - landing throttle P gain
 *    V_CTL_LANDING_THROTTLE_IGAIN - landing throttle I gain
 *    V_CTL_LANDING_THROTTLE_MAX - max landing throttle
 *    V_CTL_LANDING_DESIRED_SPEED - desired landing speed
 *    V_CTL_LANDING_PITCH_PGAIN - landing P gain
 *    V_CTL_LANDING_PITCH_IGAIN - landing I gain
 *    V_CTL_LANDING_PITCH_LIMITS - pitch limits during landing
 *    V_CTL_LANDING_PITCH_FLARE - flare P gain
 *    V_CTL_LANDING_ALT_THROTTLE_KILL - AGL to kill throttle during landing
 *    V_CTL_LANDING_ALT_FLARE - AGL to initiate final flare
 *
 *  to properly use landing control loop
