/** @file "modules/rotwing/rotwing_state.h"
 * @author Dennis van Wijngaarden <D.C.vanWijngaarden@tudelft.nl>
 * This module keeps track of the current state of a rotating wing drone and desired state set by the RC or flightplan. Paramters are being scheduled in each change of a current state and desired state. Functions are defined in this module to call the actual state and desired state and set a desired state.
