 * @brief Takes a set of optical flow vectors and extracts information such as relative velocities and surface roughness.
 *
 * A horizontal and vertical linear fit is made with the optical flow vectors, and from the fit parameters information is extracted such as relative velocities (useful for time-to-contact determination), slope angle, and surface roughness.
 *
 * Code based on the article:
 * "Optic-flow based slope estimation for autonomous landing",
 * de Croon, G.C.H.E., and Ho, H.W., and De Wagter, C., and van Kampen, E., and Remes B., and Chu, Q.P.,
 * in the International Journal of Micro Air Vehicles, Volume 5, Number 4, pages 287 â€“ 297, (2013)
