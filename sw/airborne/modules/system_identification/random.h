 * Functions for getting random numbers. The rand_gaussian() internally uses the rand_uniform().
 * rand_uniform() uses rand() internally which is initialized with the current time on rand_init().
 * This means that the board doesn't need an internal rng but comes at the cost of more computations.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * rand_init(); // initialize once
 * 
 * float random_number = rand_uniform();
