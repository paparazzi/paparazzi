 * Mathematical implementation of doublet for system identification
 * 
 * A doublet is a maneuver used during system identification procedures. The standard doublet input (1) is constituted by two consecutive step 
 * input. The two step inputs are equal in step amplitude and time lenght but opposite in sign. The standard 3-2-1-1 doublet input (2) is 
 * constituded by four step input, with decresing length in time, equal amplitude and alternating in sign.
