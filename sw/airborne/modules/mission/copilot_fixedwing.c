 *
 *  Mission Computer module, interfacing the mission computer (also known as Copilot),
 *  based losely on
 *  ISaAC: The Intelligent Safety and Airworthiness Co-Pilot module
 *  Based on paper "A Payload Verification and Management Framework
 *  for Small UAV-based Personal Remote Sensing Systems" by Cal Coopmans
 *  and Chris Coffin. Link: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6309316/
 *
 *  More info can be found on http://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/Mission_computer
 *
 *  Copilot is intended mainly for mapping applications.
 *
 *   This module processes messages from Copilot, and either forwards them to the GCS
 *  (such as CAMERA_SNAPSHOT or CAMERA_PAYLOAD messages), or responds to them as necessary
 *  (such as MOVE_WP).
 *
 *  The module assumes the source of the messages is trusted (i.e. not authentication besides
 *  AC_ID check is performed).
