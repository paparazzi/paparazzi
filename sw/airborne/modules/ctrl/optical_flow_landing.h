/**
 * @file modules/ctrl/optical_flow_landing.c
 * @brief This module implements optical flow landings in which the divergence is kept constant.
 * When using a fixed gain for control, the covariance between thrust and divergence is tracked,
 * so that the drone knows when it has arrived close to the landing surface. Then, a final landing
 * procedure is triggered. It can also be set to adaptive gain control, where the goal is to continuously
 * gauge the distance to the landing surface. In this mode, the drone will oscillate all the way down to
 * the surface.
 *
 * de Croon, G.C.H.E. (2016). Monocular distance estimation with optical flow maneuvers and efference copies:
 * a stability-based strategy. Bioinspiration & biomimetics, 11(1), 016004.
 * <http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/11/1/016004>
 *
 * Based on the above theory, we have also developed a new strategy for landing that consists of two phases:
 * (1) while hovering, the drone determines the optimal gain by increasing the gain until oscillation
 * (2) the drone starts landing while exponentially decreasing the gain over time
 *
 * This strategy leads to smooth, high-performance constant divergence landings, as explained in the article:
 * H.W. Ho, G.C.H.E. de Croon, E. van Kampen, Q.P. Chu, and M. Mulder (submitted)
 * Adaptive Control Strategy for Constant Optical Flow Divergence Landing,
