 * Periodic telemetry system header (includes downlink utility and generated code).

 * In order to use it a subsystem/module:
 * - include this header:
 *    @code
 *    #include "subsystems/datalink/telemetry.h"
 *    @endcode
 * - write a callback function:
 *    @code
 *    void your_callback(void) {
 *      // your code to send a telemetry message goes here
 *    }
 *    @endcode
 * - register your callback function (if the message name doesn't match
 *   one of the names in your telemetry xml file or is already registered,
 *   the function return FALSE)
 *    @code
 *    register_periodic_telemetry(&your_telemetry_struct, DL_<YOUR_MESSAGE_NAME>, your_callback);
 *    @endcode
 * In most cases, the default telemetry structure should be used
 * (replace &your_telemetry_struct by DefaultPeriodic in the register function).
