/**
 * @file mcu_periph/gpio.h
 *
 * Some architecture independent helper functions for GPIOs.
 *
 * Functions which should be supported by each architecture implementation:
 * - gpio_setup_output(port, gpios)
 * - gpio_setup_input(port, gpios)
 * - gpio_get(port, gpios)
 * - gpio_set(port, gpios)
 * - gpio_clear(port, gpios)
 * - gpio_toggle(port, gpios)
 *
 * This includes the architecture specific header where the actual functions are declared.
