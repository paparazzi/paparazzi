/**
 * @brief active set algorithm for control allocation
 *
 * Takes the control objective and max and min inputs from pprz and calculates
 * the inputs that will satisfy most of the control objective, subject to the
 * weighting matrices Wv and Wu
 *
 * @param u The control output vector
 * @param n_u Size of the control output vector
 * @param v The control objective vector
 * @param n_v Size of the control objective vector
 * @param umin The minimum u vector
 * @param umax The maximum u vector
 * @param B The control effectiveness matrix
 * @param n_u Length of u
 * @param n_v Lenght of v
 * @param u_guess Initial value for u
 * @param W_init Initial working set, if known
 * @param Wv Weighting on different control objectives
 * @param Wu Weighting on different controls
 * @param up Preferred control vector
 * @param gamma_sq Preference of satisfying control objective over desired
 * control vector (sqare root of gamma)
 * @param imax Max number of iterations
 *
 * @return Number of iterations, -1 upon failure
