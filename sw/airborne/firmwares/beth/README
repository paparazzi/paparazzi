The Beth test bench is two things:

    * 1. A three degree of freedom mechanical test bench
    * 2. A paparazzi build target that provides the code and configuration for the Lisa/Overo and Olimex STM32 boards mounted on item 1

Source notes: 

/*
overo_test_uart
*/

overo_test_uart target opens a serial port and parses gps messages from ublox receiver

* gps_c.patch is used to patch sw/airborne/gps.c so that the overo_test_uart target will compile
patch --dry-run  -p0 sw/airborne/gps.c < sw/airborne/beth/gps_c.patch

* currently tested on USB/serial adapters but should work just fine on the overo serial ports (assuming proper voltage level translation is in place)

TODO: GPS_CONFIGURE currently not supported 

/*
main_overo
*/

This is the initial target for overo on beth that implements control stabilization using the potentiometers values from the beth boards (via CAN), a crista IMU, wifi for datalink and telemetry.

/*
main_twisting
*/

Sliding mode control on the tilt axis, and keeping the rest of the main_overo target.

/*
main_sfb
*/

State feedback control. Will be expanded later to use diff. plat. for trajectory control.
