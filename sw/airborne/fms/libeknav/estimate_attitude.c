/* the following solver uses the Power Iteration
 *
 * It is rather simple:
 * 1. You choose a starting vektor x_0 (shouldn't be zero)
 * 2. apply it on the Matrix
 *               x_(k+1) = A * x_k
 * 3. Repeat this very often.
 *
 * The vector converges to the dominat eigenvector, which belongs to the eigenvalue with the biggest absolute value.
 *
 * But there is a problem:
 * With every step, the norm of vector grows. Therefore it's necessary to scale it with every step.
 *
 * Important warnings:
 * I.   This function does not converge if the Matrix is singular
 * II.  Pay attention to the loop-condition! It does not end if it's close to the eigenvector!
 *      It ends if the steps are getting too close to each other.
