you need some version control system as well as the kernel headers

 apt-get install mercurial linux-headers-$(uname -r) mplayer

get the source (use v4l-dvb-kernel-experimental for kernel > 2.6.20)

 hg clone http://mcentral.de/hg/~mrec/v4l-dvb-kernel

copy over the em28xx* files from the cvs and build v4l-dvb

 cd v4l-dvb-kernel
 make
 sudo make install 

copy em28xx to /etc/modprobe.d as the Pollin USB-R1 does not have an EEPROM
for auto detect (Typhoon DVD Maker works without). watch video in the gcs
with (maybe adjust the NORM)

 mplayer tv:// -tv driver=v4l2:width=320:height=240:norm=NTSC:input=0:device=/dev/video0:noaudio -ao noalsa -nolirc -nomouseinput -really-quiet

or build spook and use it to distribute through rtsp, get Debian package 
libxvidcore4-dev before configuring it

 apt-get install libxvidcore4
 apt-get install libxvidcore-dev
 cd spook
 ./configure
 make

start spook and watch video through vlc (mplayer) from it

 vlc rtsp://localhost:7070/webcam

for the Plextor, it can NOT be used at the same time as the Pollin,
v4l changes the kernel symbols and wis can not work with that
re-install the kernel if you want to use it

changing the kernel symvers somehow does not work

 cd v4l-dvb-kernel
 sudo make kernel-headers

build wis-go7007
