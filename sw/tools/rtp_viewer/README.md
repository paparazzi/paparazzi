# RTP viewer

A basic python script to view the RTP (Realtime Transport Protocol) stream generated by the video_rtp_stream module.

**OpenCV-python (>2.4) needs to be installed for the script to run.**

rtp_stream.sdp contains the stream [description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol).
The file can be modified to change the stream port, in conjunction with the video_rtp_stream module setting
VIEWVIDEO_PORT_OUT.

rtp_stream.py opens the stream and displays the frames in a window. OpenCV can be further be used to
post-process the stream. One can select a region of interest in the viewer to send a VIDEO_ROI message to the
datalink. While dragging a region, the right mouse button will cancel the selection. Pressing the 'r' key rotates
the view with increments of 90 degrees, 'q' closes the window and ends the script.
