 * @brief   Binary semaphores structures and macros.
 *
 * @addtogroup binary_semaphores
 * @details Binary semaphores related APIs and services.
 *
 *          <h2>Operation mode</h2>
 *          Binary semaphores are implemented as a set of macros that use the
 *          existing counting semaphores primitives. The difference between
 *          counting and binary semaphores is that the counter of binary
 *          semaphores is not allowed to grow above the value 1. Repeated
 *          signal operation are ignored. A binary semaphore can thus have
 *          only two defined states:
 *          - <b>Taken</b>, when its counter has a value of zero or lower
 *            than zero. A negative number represent the number of threads
 *            queued on the binary semaphore.
 *          - <b>Not taken</b>, when its counter has a value of one.
 *          .
 *          Binary semaphores are different from mutexes because there is no
 *          the concept of ownership, a binary semaphore can be taken by a
 *          thread and signaled by another thread or an interrupt handler,
 *          mutexes can only be taken and released by the same thread. Another
 *          difference is that binary semaphores, unlike mutexes, do not
 *          implement the priority inheritance protocol.<br>
 *          In order to use the binary semaphores APIs the @p CH_USE_SEMAPHORES
 *          option must be enabled in @p chconf.h.
