 * @brief   Threads registry code.
 *
 * @addtogroup registry
 * @details Threads Registry related APIs and services.
 *
 *          <h2>Operation mode</h2>
 *          The Threads Registry is a double linked list that holds all the
 *          active threads in the system.<br>
 *          Operations defined for the registry:
 *          - <b>First</b>, returns the first, in creation order, active thread
 *            in the system.
 *          - <b>Next</b>, returns the next, in creation order, active thread
 *            in the system.
 *          .
 *          The registry is meant to be mainly a debug feature, for example,
 *          using the registry a debugger can enumerate the active threads
 *          in any given moment or the shell can print the active threads
 *          and their state.<br>
 *          Another possible use is for centralized threads memory management,
 *          terminating threads can pulse an event source and an event handler
 *          can perform a scansion of the registry in order to recover the
 *          memory.
 * @pre     In order to use the threads registry the @p CH_USE_REGISTRY option
 *          must be enabled in @p chconf.h.
