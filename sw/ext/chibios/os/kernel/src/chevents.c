 *
 * @addtogroup events
 * @details Event Flags, Event Sources and Event Listeners.
 *          <h2>Operation mode</h2>
 *          Each thread has a mask of pending event flags inside its @p Thread
 *          structure.
 *          Operations defined for event flags:
 *          - <b>Wait</b>, the invoking thread goes to sleep until a certain
 *            AND/OR combination of event flags becomes pending.
 *          - <b>Clear</b>, a mask of event flags is cleared from the pending
 *            events mask, the cleared event flags mask is returned (only the
 *            flags that were actually pending and then cleared).
 *          - <b>Signal</b>, an event mask is directly ORed to the mask of the
 *            signaled thread.
 *          - <b>Broadcast</b>, each thread registered on an Event Source is
 *            signaled with the event flags specified in its Event Listener.
 *          - <b>Dispatch</b>, an events mask is scanned and for each bit set
 *            to one an associated handler function is invoked. Bit masks are
 *            scanned from bit zero upward.
 *          .
 *          An Event Source is a special object that can be "broadcasted" by
 *          a thread or an interrupt service routine. Broadcasting an Event
 *          Source has the effect that all the threads registered on the
 *          Event Source will be signaled with an events mask.<br>
 *          An unlimited number of Event Sources can exists in a system and
 *          each thread can be listening on an unlimited number of
 *          them.
 * @pre     In order to use the Events APIs the @p CH_USE_EVENTS option must be
 *          enabled in @p chconf.h.
 * @post    Enabling events requires 1-4 (depending on the architecture)
 *          extra bytes in the @p Thread structure.
