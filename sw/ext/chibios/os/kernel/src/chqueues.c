 * @brief   I/O Queues code.
 *
 * @addtogroup io_queues
 * @details ChibiOS/RT queues are mostly used in serial-like device drivers.
 *          The device drivers are usually designed to have a lower side
 *          (lower driver, it is usually an interrupt service routine) and an
 *          upper side (upper driver, accessed by the application threads).<br>
 *          There are several kind of queues:<br>
 *          - <b>Input queue</b>, unidirectional queue where the writer is the
 *            lower side and the reader is the upper side.
 *          - <b>Output queue</b>, unidirectional queue where the writer is the
 *            upper side and the reader is the lower side.
 *          - <b>Full duplex queue</b>, bidirectional queue. Full duplex queues
 *            are implemented by pairing an input queue and an output queue
 *            together.
 *          .
 * @pre     In order to use the I/O queues the @p CH_USE_QUEUES option must
 *          be enabled in @p chconf.h.
