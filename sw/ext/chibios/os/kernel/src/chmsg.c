 * @brief   Messages code.
 *
 * @addtogroup messages
 * @details Synchronous inter-thread messages APIs and services.
 *          <h2>Operation Mode</h2>
 *          Synchronous messages are an easy to use and fast IPC mechanism,
 *          threads can both act as message servers and/or message clients,
 *          the mechanism allows data to be carried in both directions. Note
 *          that messages are not copied between the client and server threads
 *          but just a pointer passed so the exchange is very time
 *          efficient.<br>
 *          Messages are scalar data types of type @p msg_t that are guaranteed
 *          to be size compatible with data pointers. Note that on some
 *          architectures function pointers can be larger that @p msg_t.<br>
 *          Messages are usually processed in FIFO order but it is possible to
 *          process them in priority order by enabling the
 *          @p CH_USE_MESSAGES_PRIORITY option in @p chconf.h.<br>
 * @pre     In order to use the message APIs the @p CH_USE_MESSAGES option
 *          must be enabled in @p chconf.h.
 * @post    Enabling messages requires 6-12 (depending on the architecture)
 *          extra bytes in the @p Thread structure.
