 *
 * @addtogroup memcore
 * @details Core Memory Manager related APIs and services.
 *          <h2>Operation mode</h2>
 *          The core memory manager is a simplified allocator that only
 *          allows to allocate memory blocks without the possibility to
 *          free them.<br>
 *          This allocator is meant as a memory blocks provider for the
 *          other allocators such as:
 *          - C-Runtime allocator (through a compiler specific adapter module).
 *          - Heap allocator (see @ref heaps).
 *          - Memory pools allocator (see @ref pools).
 *          .
 *          By having a centralized memory provider the various allocators
 *          can coexist and share the main memory.<br>
 *          This allocator, alone, is also useful for very simple
 *          applications that just require a simple way to get memory
 *          blocks.
 * @pre     In order to use the core memory manager APIs the @p CH_USE_MEMCORE
 *          option must be enabled in @p chconf.h.
