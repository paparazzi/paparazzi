 * @brief   Generic EXT Driver.
 * @details This module implements a generic EXT (EXTernal) driver.
 * @pre     In order to use the EXT driver the @p HAL_USE_EXT option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @section ext_1 Driver State Machine
 * The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver
 * functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly
 * shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall
 * be captured by an assertion (if enabled).
 * @if LATEX_PDF

 * @section ext_2 EXT Operations.
 * This driver abstracts generic external interrupt sources, a callback
 * is invoked when a programmable transition is detected on one of the
 * configured channels. Several channel modes are possible.
 * - <b>EXT_CH_MODE_DISABLED</b>, channel not used.
 * - <b>EXT_CH_MODE_RISING_EDGE</b>, callback on a rising edge.
 * - <b>EXT_CH_MODE_FALLING_EDGE</b>, callback on a falling edge.
 * - <b>EXT_CH_MODE_BOTH_EDGES</b>, callback on a both edges.
