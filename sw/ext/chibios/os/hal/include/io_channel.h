 * @brief   I/O channels access.
 * @details This header defines an abstract interface useful to access generic
 *          I/O serial devices in a standardized way.
 *
 * @addtogroup IO_CHANNEL
 * @details This module defines an abstract interface for I/O channels by
 *          extending the @p BaseSequentialStream interface.<br>
 *          Note that no code is present, I/O channels are just abstract
 *          interface like structures, you should look at the systems as
 *          to a set of abstract C++ classes (even if written in C).
 *          Specific device drivers can use/extend the interface and
 *          implement them.<br>
 *          This system has the advantage to make the access to channels
 *          independent from the implementation logic.
