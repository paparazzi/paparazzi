/**
 * @defgroup LPC214x_SERIAL LPC214x Serial Support
 * @details The LPC214x Serial driver uses the UART peripherals in a
 *          buffered, interrupt driven, implementation. The serial driver
 *          also takes advantage of the LPC214x UARTs deep hardware buffers.
 *
 * @section lpc214x_serial_1 Supported HW resources
 * The serial driver can support any of the following hardware resources:
 * - UART0.
 * - UART1.
 * .
 * @section lpc214x_serial_2 LPC214x Serial driver implementation features
 * - Clock stop for reduced power usage when the driver is in stop state.
 * - Fully interrupt driven.
 * - Programmable interrupt priority levels for each UART.
 * - Takes advantage of the input and output FIFOs.

/**
 * @defgroup LPC214x_SPI LPC214x SPI Support
 * @details The SPI driver supports the LPC214x SSP peripheral in an interrupt
 *          driven implementation.
 * @note    Being the SPI a fast peripheral, much care must be taken to
 *          not saturate the CPU bandwidth with an excessive IRQ rate. The
 *          maximum transfer bit rate is likely limited by the IRQ
 *          handling.

 * - SSP (SPI0).
