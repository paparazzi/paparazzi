 * @defgroup AT91SAM7_MII AT91SAM7 MII Support
 * @details This driver supports the AT91SAM7 EMAC peripheral communicating
 *          with an external PHY transceiver. The driver currently supports
 *          the Micrel KS8721 PHY and the Davicom DV9161 modules. This driver
 *          is used internally by the MAC driver.

 * @defgroup AT91SAM7_PAL AT91SAM7 PAL Support
 * @details The AT91SAM7 PAL driver supports the PIO peripherals.
 *
 * @section at91sam7_pal_1 Supported HW resources
 * - PIOA.
 * - PIOB.
 * .
 * @section at91sam7_pal_2 AT91SAM7 PAL driver implementation features
 * The PAL driver implementation fully supports the following hardware
 * capabilities:
 * - 32 bits wide ports.
 * - Atomic set/reset functions.
 * - Output latched regardless of the pad setting.
 * - Direct read of input pads regardless of the pad setting.
 * .
 * @section at91sam7_pal_3 Supported PAL setup modes
 * The AT91SAM7 PAL driver supports the following I/O modes:
 * - @p PAL_MODE_RESET.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_UNCONNECTED.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_INPUT.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_INPUT_ANALOG (same as @p PAL_MODE_INPUT).
 * - @p PAL_MODE_INPUT_PULLUP.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_OUTPUT_PUSHPULL.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_OUTPUT_OPENDRAIN.
 * .
 * Any attempt to setup an invalid mode is ignored.
 *
 * @section at91sam7_pal_4 Suboptimal behavior
 * The AT91SAM7 PIO is less than optimal in several areas, the limitations
 * should be taken in account while using the PAL driver:
 * - Pad/port toggling operations are not atomic.
 * - Pad/group mode setup is not atomic.
