/**
 * @defgroup SPC563_SERIAL SPC563Mx Serial Support
 * @details The SPC563Mx/MPC563xM Serial driver uses the ESCI peripherals
 *          in a buffered, interrupt driven, implementation.
 *
 * @section spc563_serial_1 Supported HW resources
 * The serial driver can support any of the following hardware resources:
 * - ESCIA.
 * - ESCIB.
 * .
 * @section spc563_serial_2 SPC563Mx Serial driver implementation features
 * - Clock stop for reduced power usage when the driver is in stop state.
 * - Each ESCI can be independently enabled and programmed. Unused
 *   peripherals are left in low power mode.
 * - Fully interrupt driven.
 * - Programmable priority levels for each ESCI.
