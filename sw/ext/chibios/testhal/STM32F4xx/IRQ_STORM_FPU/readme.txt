** TARGET **

The demo runs on an STMicroelectronics STM32F4-Discovery board.

** The Demo **

The application demonstrates the use of the STM32F4xx GPT, PAL and Serial
drivers in order to implement a system stress demo involving the FPU.

** Board Setup **

None.

** Build Procedure **

The demo has been tested using YAGARTO 4.6.2.
Just modify the TRGT line in the makefile in order to use different GCC ports.
