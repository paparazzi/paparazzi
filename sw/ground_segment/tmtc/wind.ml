(*
  Wind speed and direction are estimated from a dataset of ground speeds,
with the hypothesis that the airspeed is constant. This estimation is computed
by solving an optimization problem. The Nelder-Mead method is used
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder-Mead_method).

 Let GS(i) a set of n recorded ground speed vectors and W the wind speed.
The norm of the (hypothetically constant) mean airspeed is

  as = 1/n sum(norm(GS(i)-W))

Let

  stderr = 1/n sum (norm(GS(i)-W)-as)^2

The minimization of stderr, on the W decision variable, returns an estimation
of W.

Remarks:
 - GS(i) actually is the sequence of the _last_ recorded ground speeds.
 - In the "isotropic" implementation, each sample is weighted by its relative
difference in direction to the other samples.
