INSTALLATION:
=============

This example depends on redis, which acts as the message bus, so that package must be installed.
First install npm, then type npm install here in the node directory to install the dependent libraries. 
( Those are not saved to the repo ).

RUNNING:
========
This example is pretty minimal, but comes with software like angular, which is useful to
expand the example pretty easily into a full-blown application.

The browser is intended as a monitor application. It does not yet allow the user to execute
commands. 

When the app in the browser starts up, it asks for the ac_id to monitor. This is because it doesn't yet
implement any functionality to receive the aircraft messages and to dynamically adjust a UI to select
which ac to monitor. Just type the ac_id in that box and the rest should come up.

Steps:
1. You can start up paparazzi as usual and run a simulator or connect a real uav.
2. Then start the "ivy-to-redis" script in the python directory, which will forward messages on the ivy bus to redis.
3. Then start this app server by "node app.js"
4. You can now connect with a browser to localhost:3000
